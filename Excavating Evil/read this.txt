## Excavating Evil

**Version:** beta
**Number of levels:** 3
**Compatibility level:** Boom: Doom2 or above
**Difficulty:** TNT Evilution, with difficulty ramping up. Platforming skills are rewarded but not crutial for
progressing till the end of map 3. Tuned for all 3 difficulty settings (easy, medium, hard).


This WAD exists because decino plays Doom. -- Thank you man, you rock.


These are my very first 3 levels for DOOM 2, in order. The WAD started as a practice exercise, but eventually a whole
story grew out of it to tell. I realised that it could easily become a mega WAD with at least 3 episodes to tell the
whole story. I purposefully restricted myself to not using UDMF format, only the vanilla DOOM 2 features were allowed
for making the maps. This meant no scripting, only the vanilla linedef events, and apart from a custom skymap I created
using publicly available images and software, I forced myself to use only vanilla textures and graphics.
And vanilla music, too. Creating music for this WAD will be another project on its own.


I learnt a lot during almost 3 months of development, but the results are still a beginner's first maps, and of course
I'm not entirely satisfied with them. I put this project aside for a while now, but based on my other ongoing projects'
development and outcome, and feedbacks (if there will be any), perhaps I'll pick this project up again and finish it.


Until then, I hope you enjoy these maps.


### PREFACE
**Timeline:** before *Doom 2016* and *Doom Eternal*
UAC's search for a renewable energy source for the betterment of mankind has led to the establishment of a base, then
later, a colony on one of Mars's moons, Phobos. The colonists discovered remnants of artefacts burried under the moon's
surface, which suggested ancient signs of distant deities and realms. Eventually, these colonists founded a new
religion based on the archeological findings. UAC allowed and followed the unfolding of these events carefully, until
one day its employees reportedly made a successful contact with an intelligence from the far edges of our Solar System.
All communications ceased working with Phobos mining base immediately after the incident.

A ship was sent to Phobos colony with a crew of UAC enforcer personell to investigate the anomaly. As you boarded
the spaceport alone for scouting it, you found signs of heavy firefight on the station, but no signs of life. Radio and
video connection with your ship and crew broke, and you decided to figure out what happened with the colony.

### MAP01: Excavation Site
6735 Vertices. 7869 Linedefs.
13 secrets.

**Enemy count**
Ultra Violence: 534
Hurt Me Plenty: 379
I'm Too Young To Die / Hey, Not Too Rough: 235 


You enter the first digsite of Phobos Colony, where things escalate quickly and hell break loose.


The first map sets the gameplay expectations: Take advantage on in-fighting to save ammo, get comfortable with
occasionally manouvering and controlling enemies in tight spaces and at choke points, and explore long sequences of
secrets. Platforming is rewarded, and secret rewards are often not safe at all. You can adjust difficulty
by progressing faster or slower.


Two of the areas are either mutually skippable, or can be mutually cleared from both directions, depending on which
weapon you want to unlock. Clearing either or both of the two areas rewards you with a supercharge for the final fight.

### MAP02: The Blood Theatre
7690 Vertices. 9299 Linedefs.
9 secrets.

**Enemy count**
Ultra Violence: 738
Hurt Me Plenty: 521
I'm Too Young To Die / Hey, Not Too Rough: 317


You keep purging the evil that befell to the colony, and the way forward leads to an amphitheatre that was excavated
by the community for unknown reasons. Reasons you will soon find out.


The second map focuses on a main arena, and exploration and cautious gameplay are rewarded again.

### MAP03: Tomb of Malevolence
12299 Vertices. 14188 Linedefs.
20 secrets.

**Enemy count**
Ultra Violence: 884
Hurt Me Plenty: 670
I'm Too Young To Die / Hey, Not Too Rough: 441


Leaving behind that unholy amphitheatre you find yourself near the colony's cemetery, which turns out to be established
next to an ancient tomb. There's no turning back now. You descend to scour the evil out of that moon once and for all.
Or die trying. Which is also plausible.


The third map is a linear loop of descend and ascend, and skills like spatial awareness, in-fighting usage and
platforming are put to the test. Every area can be approached and cleared multiple different ways, and secret hunting
is at peak in this third map. Patience and caution are rewarded and safer, but clearing the arena below
can be approached differently and the difficulty can be raised dynamically based on your tempo and insanity.


As decino would put it, this map is not difficult, but it's easy to die here.
